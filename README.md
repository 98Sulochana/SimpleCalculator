# SimpleCalculator

Overview
This is my first Delphi project, a simple calculator application. I created this project to learn the basics of Delphi programming and to practice building a graphical user interface (GUI) application.

Features
Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Ability to clear the input field.
Backspace functionality to delete the last character.
Plus-minus toggle to change the sign of the displayed number.
Decimal point (dot) functionality for floating-point numbers.
Getting Started
To run this project, you will need to have Delphi installed on your system. Simply open the project file (CalculatorApp.dproj) in Delphi and compile/run the application.

Usage
Enter numbers using the number buttons (0 to 9).
Perform arithmetic operations using the corresponding buttons (+, -, *, /).
Use the equals button (=) to display the result.
Use the clear button (C) to clear the input field.
Use the backspace button (<-) to delete the last character.
Use the plus-minus button (+/-) to toggle the sign of the displayed number.
Use the decimal point button (.) to input floating-point numbers.
